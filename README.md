Play the game Sushi Go electronically with 2 players - python project.

Have you ever played the card game Sushi Go? Regardless, you will now have the chance to play it electronically. Here are the rules:

Each player will get 10 cards each.

The rest of the cards will be placed in a face-down pile called the draw pile. This pile will be used in the next rounds to deal from.

The game takes place over 3 rounds. To start a round, all players choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep and place it face-down in front of them. When each player has done this, everyone reveals their chosen cards. This card will be placed in the face-up pile and will remain until the end of the round when the current score is calculated and updated.

After revealing the cards, pass your remaining hand face-down to the other player. Everyone picks up their new hands and the next turn begins. You now have a new and smaller hand to choose from.

Face-up cards remain with you until the end of the round when they are scored.

Wasabi cards are used to pair with nigiri cards and only 1 nigiri card may be paired with each wasabi card.

Chopsticks card: If you already have a chopsticks card in your faced-up pile, you may take 2 cards to place down on a future turn.

– Note: Before passing hands, put the chopsticks card back into your hand. This means it will now be passed on, and other players may take it to use again.

– You may have multiple chopsticks cards in front of you but may only use 1 per turn.

When the final remaining card of each hand is passed on, simply place it faced-up with the other cards you have collected.

Sum up the score and add it to the current score for each player.

Start the next round.

The cards from the previous round’s faced-up pile will be discarded except for Puddings cards. These will be kept until the 3rdround to be scored at the end of the game.

Each player gets another 10 cards dealt from the draw pile.

After the third round is scored, score all the cards plus the Puddings cards.

• SCORING:

– Maki rolls: Count the amount of maki rolls. The player with the most maki rolls will get 6 points. If multiple players tie for the most, each will get 3 points since we have 2 players. Otherwise, the person with less maki rolls will score 3 points. The person with no maki roll will score nothing.
